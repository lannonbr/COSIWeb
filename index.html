      <h1>What is COSI</h1>
      <p>
        COSI is the main part of the Applied CS Labs at clarkson
        University. I have been involved with the labs since the
        first few weeks that I was on campus during my freshman year.
        Since then, I have grown to being one of the leaders of the
        labs and I am very willing to continue making the labs
        better while I am at Clarkson.

        This site is a portfolio of all of the projects that I have
        done throughout the years.
