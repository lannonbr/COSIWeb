      <h1>Freshman Year in COSI</h1>
      <p>These are some major contributions of mine during my Freshman year.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Meeting Minutes (March 2015 - November 2015)
          <p>
            Threre was a large gap since there was someone did Meeting
            Minutes for the labs, so I decided that it would be useful
            to revive them to have an active log of our meetings and
            events that had happened through the years.
          </p>
          <p>
            I handed it the project off to Michael Hrcek in November
            2015, but he since has left Clarkson, so I will be picking
            up the project again temporarily.
