      <h1>Junior year in COSI</h1>
      <p>
        These are some major contributions of mine that will be made
        during my Junior year.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>ML Course (Planned project)
          <p>
            Michael Fulton and myself are planning on teaching a weekly
            course on the fundamentals of Machine Learning which people
            who take the course will be able to get credit for.
            
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>COSI Newsletter (Planned project)
          <p>
            A weekly newsletter is something that I've wanted to work on for
            awhile, but I think it will be doable to make in this upcoming
            semester. It will consist of a link to the previous week's Meeting
            Minutes, a schedule of events for the upcoming week, and a "Meet a
            Cosinaught" section as well.
