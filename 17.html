			<h1>Junior year in COSI</h1>
			<p>
				These are some major contributions of mine have been made during my
				Junior year
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>COSI Ansible Playbooks (Summer 2016)
					<p>
						I wrote an Ansible Playbook which automates the process of adding
						central Authentication (LDAP/Kerberos/NFS) to any Debian machine
						in the labs. I'll be working with James Bruska to continue automating
						various tasks in the labs as well as have a rich amount of documentation
						on how to use the scripts.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>ML Course (Planned project)
					<p>
						Michael Fulton and myself are planning on teaching a weekly
						course on the fundamentals of Machine Learning which people
						who take the course will be able to get credit for.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>COSI Newsletter (Summer 2016 - Present)
					<p>
						The weekly newsletter, also known as COSI News, is a project I begun
						to give a peek into the week of what is happening in COSI, and what
						progress has been made. So far it has consisted of upcoming projects,
						but as the semester begins, I plan on adding a link to the previous
						week's Meeting Minutes, a schedule of events for the upcoming week,
						and a "Meet a Cosinaught" section as well.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>COSI History (Summer 2016 - Present)
					<p>
						COSI has existed for over 15 years, and I wanted to create a page to
						look back through the history of the labs and try to get as much of
						a complete timeline of the labs as we can.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>"Linux Workflow Workshop" Series (Planned Project)
					<p>
						Michael Fulton and myself are also planning on being the main leaders
						of a series of workshops where we give introductions to many different
						aspects of the Linux Workflow (Text editors, Version Control, Testing &
						Continuous Integration, etc.). Michael and I are going to be the leads
						for the series, but anyone else is welcome to contribute to the project.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>COSI VM (Planned Project)
					<p>
						The COSI VM was a project suggested by Jeanna Matthews to give people who are
						new to Linux a VirtualBox image with a setup very similar to the lab images.
					</p>
				</li>
