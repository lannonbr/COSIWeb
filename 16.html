      <h1>Sophmore Year in COSI</h1>
      <p>These are some major contributions of mine during my Sophmore year.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Project Updates (Summer 2015 - Present)
          <p>
            Similar to Meeting Minutes, Project Updates is a site where
            updates to projects in COSI can be presented. The site runs
            using Jekyll, so the ease of pushing an post to the site is
            only a git push.
            
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>COSI / ITL Linux Build (Summer 2015 - Present)
          <p>
            Before the 2015-2016 semester, I was given the role of
            maintaining the lab builds for the year. The ITL build
            was a standard Debian 8 build which was extremely similar
            to the previous year's build. The COSI build, though,
            was built on top of the ITL build and also included
            NFS support through the Kerberos authentication system
            set up by other lab members through the summer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am likely to be handing it off to someone else
            after the 2016-2017 year.
            
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Docs (August 2015 - Present)
          <p>
            During the summer I was interested in maintaining our
            documentation server which is running a mediawiki website.
            The previous maintainer handed it off to me. Over the year,
            I have been keeping up to date with new hardware and updates
            to existing infrastructure.
            
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>CSLabs Webpage Updates (Fall 2015)
          <p>
            I gave a refresh to COSI's main website after feeling
            a bit outdated. It now is mobile friendly and has more
            present and up to date content.
            
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Talks (Fall 2015 - Present)
          <p>
            Talks is a web application that serves as a place for people
            to post talks or topics that they'll be presenting at our
            Wednesday meetings.
            
          </p>
          <p>
            It was originally built using the python web framework Flask,
            but since has been rewritten as a NodeJS application.
            
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Navigation Header (November 2015 - Present)
          <p>
            I added a navigation bar to the top of most of our web
            services that allows for easy access to other COSI sites.
            
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Directorship (November 2015 - Present)
          <p>
            I was offered and accepted the role as a lab director.
            The position is mainly a point of contact between COSI
            and the rest of the campus as well as a mediator at
            meetings and resolver of conflicts in the labs.
            
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Dubsdot (Spring 2016 - Present)
          <p>
            Dubsdot was a rebirth of previous COSI webservers. The server
            is running as a VM on one of our VM Hosts, Bennu, and is
            currently hosting Fsuvius, Talks, and Print.
            
            
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Mirror Website (December 2015 - Present)
          <p>
            With the building of the new FOSS Mirror for COSI, I built
            a brand new website for it. The style is much more modern,
            and it also presents statistics on the network traffic since
            it launched in April 2016.
